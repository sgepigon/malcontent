# Malcontent
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ecmendenhall/malcontent.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ecmendenhall/malcontent)

Content Security Policy is a new browser security mechanism to prevent
[cross site
scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS\))
attacks. By sending a 'Content-Security-Policy' header in HTTP
responses, web applications can provide rules and restrictions for
client side scripts, plugins, frames, and other resources. Most [modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy)
enforce these restrictions, preventing injection of malicious
javascript, and effectively shutting down most XSS attacks. 

Malcontent is a simple middleware handler for adding the CSP header to Ring applications. Simply specify a security policy as a Clojure map and malcontent will include it in responses to supported browsers.

## Usage
Malcontent looks for a policy file at `config/security_policy.clj` by default (but you can pass in your own path if you'd prefer). Here are the examples from the [HTML5 Rocks introduction to CSP](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/#real-world-usage) as malcontent maps:

__Social media widgets:__

```clj
{:sources {:script ["https://apis.google.com"
                    "https://platform.twitter.com"]
           :frame  ["https://plusone.google.com"
                    "https://facebook.com"
                    "https://platform.twitter.com"]}}
```

__Lockdown:__

```clj
{:sources {:default :none
           :script  "https://cdn.mybank.net"
           :style   "https://cdn.mybank.net"
           :img     "https://cdn.mybank.net"
           :connect "https://api.mybank.com"
           :frame   :self}}
```

__SSL Only__:

```clj
{:sources {:default "https:"
           :script  ["https:" :unsafe-inline]
           :style   ["https:" :unsafe-inline]}}
```

In addition to sources, policy maps may include the `:sandbox` and
`:report-uri` directives. Sources may be specified as strings,
keywords, or vectors. Here's an example with every directive enabled:

```clj
{:sources {:default :self
           :script ["https://trustedscripts.com" :unsafe-eval]
           :style ["*.styles.example.com"
                   "https://inlinestyles.info"
                   :unsafe-inline]
           :img "*"
           :connect "https:"
           :font "http://webfonts.biz"
           :object :none
           :media ["http://media.example.com"]
           :frame :self}
 :sandbox [:allow-forms
           :allow-scripts
           :allow-top-navigation]
 :report-uri "/some/report-uri"}
```

Mapping [CSP directives](http://content-security-policy.com/) to Clojure values is simple: special values like `'self'`, `'none'`, and `'unsafe-inline'` become keywords, while sources like `https:` `*.example.com` and `https://example.com` become strings.

To include the policy in outgoing responses, just include `add-content-security-policy` as a middleware wrapper:

```clj
(ns my-great-webapp.core
  (:require [malcontent.core :refer [add-content-security-policy]]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] my-great-request-handler))
  
(def app (-> routes
             (add-content-security-policy)))
```

If you'd prefer to load the policy from somewhere besides the default location, pass it as a keyword argument:

```clj
(def app (-> routes
             (add-content-security-policy :config-path "resources/policy.clj")))
```
